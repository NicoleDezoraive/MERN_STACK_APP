# Workout Buddy - MERN Stack App

I have developed a website that serves as a personalized training plan display. The inspiration for this project came from my partner's unfortunate experience of having his training program pages scattered and destroyed by a mischievous dog. To solve this problem, I created a website that efficiently manages his training regimen.

The website allows my partner to add his training exercises, providing him with a clear overview of the number of repetitions he needs to perform. Additionally, the platform offers the flexibility to remove any irrelevant exercises, ensuring that nothing is lost or forgotten.

To build this project, I utilized the **MERN stack**, which includes MongoDB for the database, Express for the web framework, React for the user interface, and Node.js for the server-side runtime environment. The deployment of the website was done using Render, which may result in a short delay before the site loads upon clicking the link, as it undergoes a **warm-up** process.

Currently, I am actively working on implementing a **login and registration feature** through Google authentication. By integrating this functionality, the website will be able to cater to a broader audience, providing assistance to individuals who are seeking a reliable platform for managing their training programs.
